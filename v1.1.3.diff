v1.1.3 (unreleased)
daily gift stuff

Changes:
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.

Bug fixes:
+ Duped necrotite ore now has the same lifetime as the ore it was duped by. (both will die at the same time)
+ Applied effects no longer overwrite death timers. Example: Passing an ore into 3
+ Removed whispering ingame-- it would create extra chat tabs, which is annoying to me
+ Box select is now available again on mobile and PC
+ The bottom bar buttons now have images of their respective items

Balance Changes:
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
- Exotic and secret chances in both Regular and Unreal crates have been nerfed heavily
