v1.1.2 (unreleased)
general bug fixes

Bug fixes:
+ Duped necrotite ore now has the same lifetime as the ore it was duped by. (both will die at the same time)
+ Applied effects no longer overwrite death timers. Example: Passing an ore into 3
+ Bottom bar no longer prevents you from placing when moving
+ Ore Limit not updating when limit upgrade is purchased (visual)
+ Fixed animations for sawmill and the plasma upgrader break when a plot is expanded
+ Fixed a lag spike on lower end devices when standing inside of a placed item
+ Fixed a bug where controller DPadUp wouldn't work inside of the inventory
+ Fixed ore not despawning after getting stuck
+ Fixed UI occasionally not loading on client for a few seconds


NEXT UPDATE:
Changes:
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!
+ Lambda rework (uncapped, higher chance to destroy after more upgrades. TBD)

Bug fixes:
+ Plot radio now ACTUALLY works. I am so sorry it took so long.
+ Box select is now available again on mobile and PC
+ The bottom bar buttons now have images of their respective items

Balance Changes:
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
- Exotic and secret chances in both Regular and Unreal crates have been nerfed heavily

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- Centering Conveyor is awful
- UI not loading because Crates model is being destroyed on the server (?!, still investigating)
- Teleporting while sitting will teleport the seat
- Cannot move items in the safe zone while inventory is closed
- Big ore phase through teleporters/furnaces sometimes and are destroyed before being teleported/processed
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
