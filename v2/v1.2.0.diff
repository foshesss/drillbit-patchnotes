+ Complete redesign of the bottom bar, so it is less wordy [X]
+ Redesigned notifications [X]
+ Added that the Lambda Upgrader gives sparkles in it's item description. [X]

Balance Changes:
+ Lamba's destroy rate is now officially (1 - 1.5/x), where 'x' is the amount of times an ore has been upgraded by the Lambda Upgrader. [X]
+ X-Ray Refiner multiplier increased from 1.2x -> 1.4x [X]

XP and Levels Work:

+ Gold Crates now give 400-800 XP
+ Diamond Crates now give 2500-4500 XP
+ Crystal Crates now give 40-80 XP
+ Big Crystal Crates now give 400-800 XP

Crate Changes:
+ Crates are now completely client-sided, and now coming slamming down instead of having physics. This will hopefully be helpful with performance for the server and lower-end devices. [X]
+ Crate despawn time has been changed from 45s -> 90s [X]
+ Crates now have a timer above them, indicating when they will despawn [X]
+ Default crate spawn time is now a static 12s per crate. With a skill tree upgrade, this will be 6 seconds per crate. [X]
+ Diamond Crates now give 6-12 crystals, up from 5-10.

- Gold Crates now have a 40% chance to give a box, reduced from 100%.
- Big Crystal Crates now give 20-30 crystals, down from 50-100
- Crystal crates now give 8-16 crystals, down from 10-20


Bug Fixes:
+ Along with client-sided crates, the UI all being missing bug is now gone. [X]
+ Teleporters now behave EXACTLY as intended-- no more ghost/delayed teleporting. [X]
+ Upgraders no longer have ghost/delayed upgrades [X]

Crystal Changes (thoughts):
Right now, the Crystal economy is extremely saturated, so I made the decision to remove crystals from most crates. Your main source of crystals should be leveling up,
and the occasional crystal crate. As a result, prices for most Premium tier items have decreased drastically. Crates will still be a great source for boxes, but
they will not yield the same crystal rewards.

Crystals, in this update, now have a lot more uses though, encouraging you to spend wisely. Rebirth Rerolls, (optionally) Skill Tree Upgrades, and the existing purchasing Boxes.
Hopefully, this will make crystals worth more, and they won't just be seen as pointless. I'll continue iterating on this over time with feedback, but I hope that you enjoy these changes.

PLANNED:
Changes:
+ Box Select is back in the game-- this took so long due to cross compatability support.
+ Gifting items
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
+ Expand and collapse inventory is now back on PC

+ NEW PREMIUM ITEM: Paint Spill, randomly changed your ore's color ( by THEskelactorXx ), delayed for model conveyor being jank.

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
