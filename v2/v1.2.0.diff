v1.2.0
aint not question if i want it, i need it

Changes:
+ Box Select is back in the game-- this took so long due to cross compatability support.
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request
+ Tutorial for new players, including logging to identify player dropoff
+ Boxes are now completely client-sided, and now coming slamming down instead of having physics. This will hopefully be helpful with performance for the server and lower-end devices.
+ Lamba's destroy rate is now officially (1 - .9/x), where 'x' is the amount of times an ore has been upgraded by the Lambda Upgrader.
+ Ore Limit upgrade is officially gone. It took a lot of thinking for me, but mobile players NEED to be able to adjust their ore limit. It alos feels like a useless upgrade to me.

+ NEW PREMIUM ITEM: Paint Spill, randomly changed your ore's color ( by THEskelactorXx )
+ NEW SHOP ITEM: Pinpoint Upgrader, an item that costs 30sx ( by SOGGYPOO66 )
+ NEW SHOP ITEM: Ore Slump, a new way to catch your ore on fire! ( by crusanfrye )
+ NEW REBIRTH: Ethereal Island, a way-up high upgrader available at Life 35 ( by McFanOfMcdonalds )
+ NEW REBIRTH: Crimsonsteel Archway, a way-up high upgrader available to players at Life 20 ( by valphex )
+ NEW REBIRTH: Enchanted Glade, a ground upgrader available at Life 15 ( by SorryWereCIosed )
+ NEW REBIRTH: Ore Sapper, a ground upgrader available to players at Life 10 ( by AwfulUnlawful )
+ NEW REBIRTH: Golden Blessing, a ground upgrader available to players at Life 50 ( by Tnt0gamer2 )

Accessibility Changes:
+ Dropper tooltip's now show their ore's color.
+ NEW SETTING: Colorblind Mode, which shows an ore's color above the ore.

UI Changes:
+ Plot Actions has been moved from the right side of your screen to the bottom
+ Complete redesign of the bottom bar, so it is less wordy
+ Redesigned notifications

Balance Changes:
+ X-Ray Refiner multiplier increased from 1.2x -> 1.4x
+ Lamp placement limit has been buffed from 16 -> 20
- Maximum Ore Limit decreased from 125 -> 100

Crate Changes:
+ Crate despawn time has been changed from 45s -> 90s
+ Crates are now client-sided
+ Crates now have a timer above them, indicating when they will despawn
+ Default crate spawn time is now a static 12s per crate. With a skill tree upgrade, this will be 6 seconds per crate.

Bug Fixes:
+ Along with client-sided crates, the UI all being missing bug is now gone.
+ Teleporters now behave EXACTLY as intended-- no more ghost/delayed teleporting.
+ Upgraders no longer have ghost/delayed upgrades

PLANNED:
Changes:
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
+ Expand and collapse inventory is now back on PC

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
