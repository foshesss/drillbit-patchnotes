v1.1.5

PLANNED:
Changes:
+ Box select is now available again on mobile and PC
+ The bottom bar buttons now have images of their respective items
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!
+ Daily gifts are now juiced

Bug fixes:
+ Plot radio now ACTUALLY works. I am so sorry it took so long.

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- UI not loading because Crates model is being destroyed on the server (?!, still investigating)
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
