v1.1.4

Bug fixes:
+ Teleporting while sitting in a chair no longer teleports the seat with you
+ Gunium and Necrotite orientation are now that same as all other droppers when placing
+ Centering conveyor now works properly when your plot is expanded (was teleporting ore to the original centering location)
