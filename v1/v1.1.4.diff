v1.1.4
bogus day of bug fixing, small refactoring

Changes:
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of your screen (sorry mobile!)

QOL Changes:
+ Placing in mobile now starts the placement in the center of your screen, as opposed to the last used position.

Bug fixes:
+ Changed some naming conventions in order to mitigate a floating point error on PS4.
+ Furnaces have received a small netcode update that should hopefully fix ore not being processed
+ Teleporting while sitting in a chair no longer teleports the seat with you
+ Gunium and Necrotite orientation are now that same as all other droppers when placing
+ Centering conveyor now works properly when your plot is expanded (was teleporting ore to the original centering location)
