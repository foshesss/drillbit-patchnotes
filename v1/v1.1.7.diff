v1.1.7 (v1.1.6 got lost to time)
crate stuff

Changes:
+ Box select is now available again on mobile and PC
+ The bottom bar buttons now have images of their respective items
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request

Balance Changes:
+ Lamp placement limit has been buffed from 16 -> 20

Crate Changes:
+ Crate despawn time has been changed from 45s -> 90s
+ Crates are now client-sided
+ Crates now have a timer above them, indicating when they will despawn

Bug Fixes:
+ Along with client-sided crates, the UI all being missing bug is now gone.
+ Teleporters now behave EXACTLY as intended-- no more ghost/delayed teleporting.
+ Upgraders no longer have ghost/delayed upgrades.

PLANNED:
Changes:
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
+ Expand and collapse inventory is now back on PC

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
