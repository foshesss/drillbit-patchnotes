v1.1.3
bug fixes, small reworks

Changes:
+ New Centering Conveyor model, which will GUARANTEE center everything
+ Lambda Upgrader has been reworked. Now, upgrades from it are uncapped, but the more an ore is upgraded, the higher the chance it will be destroyed.

Balance Changes:
+ Daily gifts are now juiced
- Exotic and secret chances in both Regular and Unreal crates have been nerfed heavily

Bug Fixes:
+ Hacksaw model bug when expanding base is now completely fixed.
+ Now, when an effect is applied, the lowest death timer will take precedence. This is the intended behavior.
+ Fixed big ore from being destroyed when falling from high heights into a furnace or teleporter

NEXT UPDATE:
Changes:
+ Box select is now available again on mobile and PC
+ The bottom bar buttons now have images of their respective items
+ Plot Actions has been moved back to the bottom bar, by request
+ Daily gift has been moved to the right side of the screen (sorry mobile)
+ Daily gift now prompts the second gift once, and only once, per day. Within this menu is an option to buy a second daily gift OR permanent daily gifts.
+ Global shouts! You can now pay 60c to send a message that will be broadcasted to all servers!

Bug fixes:
+ Plot radio now ACTUALLY works. I am so sorry it took so long.

Known Issues:
- Rejoining the game after being idle makes it seem like your data reset
- UI not loading because Crates model is being destroyed on the server (?!, still investigating)
- Teleporting while sitting will teleport the seat
- Whispering creates a new text channel. Really bad. Really ugly. IDEA: Override whisper command (?!)
