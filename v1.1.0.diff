v1.1.0
welcome back mobile and console

Changes:
+ Revamped Build Mode UI, now with more responsive animations, a better search, useful keybind actions, and more helpful categories.
+ Mobile and Console are now supported.
+ Creator tags in chat for recognized creators
+ Crate storms, and global crates storms! Spawnable by machine in the middle of the map, will make a ton of crates spawn for 20 seconds. In addition, every day, a free crate storm will appear globally-- the time is forecasted next to the machine.
+ NEW REBIRTH: Hacksaw, slice your ore into two equal parts
+ NEW REBIRTH: Periastron's Choice, a rare furnace that will process ore at 65x, ONLY if the previous ore is identical to the first.
+ NEW REBIRTH: Necrotite Dropper, a powerful mine, but droppers are DESTROYED after some time.
+ Placement limits, limiting how many of CERTAIN items you can place (example: Campfires)-- this is to prevent bad actors from spamming particles which may be intensive on other devices.
+ Purchasing gamepasses/devproducts/crystals are now broadcasted to the server.
- You can no longer select items while in Build Mode. This was just a major painpoint and confusion.
- Rebirth pricing is now far steeper for higher life players. This is to keep the game challenging, and to encourage experimenting (see attached picture for rebirth curve change).

Fixes:
+ The server now announces when a Diamond crate has spawned.
+ Players with no tags next to their names now have their username colored as their team color
+ Unbox reward now appear in announcements after you've unboxed them (doesn't spoil what you're unboxing).
+ Fixed leaderboards occasionally not loading on the client.
+ Fixed a bug where 7 player servers would crash becuase boxes spawned every frame.
+ Submitted items now show the username of the person that created them.
+ Officially fixed 2 people appearing on the same team. Shoulda never happened.
+ Centering conveyors center ores.
+ Changed 'an' to 'a' in announcements.
+ Confirm/remove buttons have been added to the plot selector/material selector submenus.
+ Plot Radio is now working, my fault

Balances Changes:

QOL Changes:
+ You can now click on the build bar to exit a menu
+ Boxes menu now has an exit button
+ Boxes now have pity, depending on the type of box
+ Removed spamming invalid upgrade sounds-- this'll hopefully help with coming back to a laggy base
+ Fixed ore erroring when walking on/off your base (this has to do with switching ore network ownership)
+ Recents tab for your most recent placed items
+ Ore wash now has a list of effects it cleans
- You can no longer select items while in Build Mode. This was just a major painpoint and confusion.
