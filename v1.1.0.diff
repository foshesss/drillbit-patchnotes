v1.1.0
welcome back mobile and console

Changes:

+ NEW REBIRTH: Hacksaw, slice your ore into two equal parts
+ NEW REBIRTH: Periastron's Choice, a rare furnace that will process ore at 65x, ONLY if the previous ore is identical to the first.
+ NEW REBIRTH: Necrotite Dropper, a powerful mine, but droppers are DESTROYED after some time. [X]

- You can no longer select items while in Build Mode. This was just a major painpoint and confusion. [X]
